# Obstacle-Course-Game
Hi! This is my first game I created using Unity. It's a simple -- yet quite addicting -- obstacle course game which I hope to keep improving on.

To play, simply shift your player right and left by hitting the 'A' and 'D' keys. Be sure to avoid all the obstacles! When you reach the end of a level, you will receive a chocolate cookie (just kidding!). 

Have fun!
