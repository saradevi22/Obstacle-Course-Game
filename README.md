# Obstacle-Course-Game
Hi! This is my first game I created using Unity. It's a simple -- yet quite addicting -- obstacle course game which I hope to keep improving on. I would like to thank the Brackeys YouTube Channel for posting amazing content on how to develop in Unity, as that helped me get a grasp of the basics.

To play, simply shift your player right and left by hitting the 'A' and 'D' keys. Be sure to avoid all the obstacles! When you reach the end of a level, you will receive a chocolate cookie (just kidding!). 

Have fun & enjoy!



# How to Play:

1. Use this link to open the game into a web browser: http://localhost:59714

2. It may take a few seconds to load, but once it does, the game will imeediately start running. 

3. Refreshing the tab will restart the game to level one. 

4. Enjoy!



# How to Download and Make Changes:

1. Download the Unity Hub and engine from https://unity.com/. You'll need to create an account to get started.

2. Next, download the code from this repository as a ZIP file. 

3. Open up 'Unity' on your computer, and click 'Add' (which will direct you add a file from your computer). 

4. Locate the ZIP file in your downloads folder, and click on the "Obstacle Course Game" folder. This will add all the assets of the game into the project that you're adding. 

5. When the download process is complete, the game will open. Hit the 'Play' button to start playing. 

6. Save a copy of the game for yourself, and make whatever adjustments you wish!
