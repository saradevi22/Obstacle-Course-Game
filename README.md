# Obstacle-Course-Game
Hi! This is my first game I created using Unity. It's a simple -- yet quite addicting -- obstacle course game which I hope to keep improving on. I would like to thank the Brackeys YouTube Channel for posting amazing content on how to develop in Unity, as that helped me get a grasp of the basics in Unity. 

To play, simply shift your player right and left by hitting the 'A' and 'D' keys. Be sure to avoid all the obstacles! When you reach the end of a level, you will receive a chocolate cookie (just kidding!). 

Have fun!


How to Download & Play: 

1. Download the Unity Hub and engine from https://unity.com/. You'll need to create an account to get started.

2. Next, download the code from this repository as a ZIP file. 

3. Open up 'Unity' on your computer, and click 'Add' (which will direct you add a project from your computer). 

4. Locate the ZIP file in your downloads folder, and click on the "Obstacle Course Game" folder. This will add all the assets of the game into the project that you're adding. 

5. When the process is done, the game will open. Once you hit the 'Play' button, you can begin to play the game.
